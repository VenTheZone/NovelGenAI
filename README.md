      # NovelGenAI - Cyberpunk Novel Generator

      NovelGenAI is a web application that uses the OpenRouter API and the power of AI (specifically, Google's Gemini Pro model) to help you generate a cyberpunk-themed novel.  It allows you to define a character, provide chapter roadmaps, and maintain context across multiple chapters, resulting in a more coherent and engaging story.

      ## Features

      *   **Character Customization:** Define your main character's name, personality traits, and the overall writing style of the novel. This allows you to shape the tone and voice of your story.
      *   **Chapter-Based Generation:** Generate your novel chapter by chapter.  Provide a roadmap or prompt for each chapter, guiding the AI's creative process.
      *   **Contextual Awareness:** The AI considers previously generated chapters when creating new ones. This helps maintain consistency and continuity throughout the story.
      *   **Interactive Chapter Library:**  A pop-up library allows you to easily browse, read, rename, and delete generated chapters.
      *   **Mobile Responsiveness:** The application is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes.
      *   **Cyberpunk 2077 Inspired Theme:**  The user interface is styled with a vibrant, neon-infused aesthetic.
      *   **Save Chapters:** Explicitly save generated chapters to the library.
      *   **Rename and Delete Chapters:** Manage your chapter library by renaming or deleting chapters as needed.
      *   **View Chapter Content:** Read the content of each chapter directly within the chapter library.
      *   **Clear User Guidance:** Input fields now include placeholder text to guide users.
      *   **Generation Feedback:**  A "Generating..." message provides visual feedback during chapter creation.

      ## Getting Started

      1.  **Prerequisites:** You'll need an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).  Create an account and obtain your key.
      2.  **Installation:**
          *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
          *   Navigate to the project directory (where this README is located).
          *   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
              ```bash
              npm install
              ```
      3.  **Running the Application:**
          *   Start the development server with:
              ```bash
              npm run dev
              ```
          *   The application will typically open automatically in your browser. If not, you'll see a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in the terminal that you can open.
